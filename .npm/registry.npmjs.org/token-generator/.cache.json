token-generator\n\n[![Test Status](http://strider.findhit.com/findhit/token-generator/badge)](http://strider.findhit.com/findhit/token-generator) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/findhit/token-generator.svg)](https://david-dm.org/findhit/token-generator)\n\nan offline token generator and validator\n\n## What does it does?\n\nIt works on top of one dynamic variable, an expired timestamp, we simply create two\nthings from it: an **hash part** and an **obfuscated timestamp**.\n\nSo, whenever you hit `.generate`, it will render a different token that could be\nalways validated (even on different processes, or different nodes) as since you\nconfigure it with same `salt` and `timestampMap`.\n\nSeems complex?\n( If not, you really should dig on this and help us to make it even better )\n\n## Why should i use it?\n\n- It's **Open-Source** and free to use;\n- You could contribute to it;\n- It's extendable, because it's built on top of [findhit-class](https://github.com/findhit/class);\n- You don't have to maintain a data source such as a **database table** to store\n  tokens, each token carries its own check;\n- It's secure, and you could increase security by providing your own hash method;\n- We are also using it, if we trust on it, you should do it also!\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n\n    npm i --save token-generator\n\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nToken Generator is designed to have a simple impementation.\nYou just need to create an TG with your own options just like the example above:\n\n```js\n\nvar TokenGenerator = require( 'token-generator' )({\n        salt: 'your secret ingredient for this magic recipe',\n        timestampMap: 'abcdefghij', // 10 chars array for obfuscation proposes\n    });\n\n```\n\nThen you could generate and validate tokens simply as:\n\n```js\n\nvar token = TokenGenerator.generate();\n\n```\n\nAnd check with:\n\n```js\n\nif ( TokenGenerator.isValid( token ) ) {\n    // ...\n} else {\n    // ...\n}\n\n// You could also use\n// .isInvalid\n// .isntValid\n// .isntInvalid\n\n```\n\nIf you catch an invalid token, you could check why it is invalid by validating\nmanually with `.validate`\n\n```js\n\ntry{\n    TokenGenerator.validate( token )\n} catch ( error ) {\n\n    // For security proposes, error will always be 'Invalid or expired token'\n    console.error( error )\n\n    // But you can dig it up by checking `.parent` Error\n    console.error( error.parent );\n\n}\n\n```\n\n## Have you liked this?\n\nPlease, star this repo and if you find any issue don't hesitate to fill it or\nto provide a Pull Request.
